+TextSiri
---

TextSiri is an IRC bot with outstanding modularity. All of its power comes from **modules**, a new way to add commands to your bot! Simply throw all of your modules to the **modules** folder, and you are set!

+Requirements
---

 - Python 3
 - irclib 13

+Configuration
---

When you first run TextSiri it will create a new file for you called **config.cfg**. All of the bot's behavior can be changed from here. This is also where your bot's modules' configuration stays. Keep it safe!

+Modules
---

All of the modules that I have created can be found [here](http://github.com/mission712/textsiri-modules). Simply throw them in the **modules** directory. They will automatically create their configuration files, and you may change them while the bot's running (Feature of the *Reload* module).
